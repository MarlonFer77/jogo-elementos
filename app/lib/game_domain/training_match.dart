/// A local, offline 1v1 match where the same device controls both sides —
/// "Modo treino" (seção 12). No backend, no multiplayer, no AI opponent.
///
/// Each player has their own [SkillProgress] over `defaultSkillTree`: they
/// can unlock skill nodes on their turn, and every mutation/combination
/// modifier/HP bonus they've unlocked applies automatically — mutations
/// and combination modifiers to every action they take from then on (an
/// [Ability]/[Build] built fresh each turn from whatever elements they
/// picked + everything they've unlocked); a [MaxHpBonus] applies to their
/// HP immediately, live, since it doesn't wait for their next action. Two
/// players unlocking different nodes get different results from the same
/// elements — the promise from the design doc (seção 7), now playable.
///
/// Both players start at 100 HP (base) plus whatever [MaxHpBonus] they've
/// unlocked. A combination's damage always hits the opponent of whoever
/// played it; the match ends the moment either player's HP reaches 0.
///
/// Exposes only Flutter-friendly types, never a `battle_engine` type — ver
/// DECISION-011/017.
